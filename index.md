# Nikita's Engineering Lessons
# Welcome to my blog!
---
<p> As an engineer, there's nothing I love more than learning new lessons and documentation. I created this blog as an opportunity to collect and record the lessons I have learned in my work place and personal life. These blogs will be mostly geared towards all things engineering however I may sprinkle in other things that inspire me. </p>
<p> A little bit about my work experience, I have a bachelors in Mechanical Engineering and a Masters in Industrial Engineering. I currently work as a manufacturing engineer in wire manufacturing and before that worked as a process improvement engineer in a hospital. </p>
<p> I am trying to expand my skills in programming and currently working on a python model of a burger restaurant (I was inspired by my favorite burger place, In and Out). My goal with this model is find the most optimal layout and use of resources to reduce customer wait time. </p>
<p> In my freetime I am currently restoring a 2004 Suburban Z71 and a 1993 Kawasaki Vulcan 750. I love riding anything with 2 wheels and currently cycle a lot on a road bike, I hope to enter in my first race soon. </p>
