TLDR: Good communication between cross-functional teams is essential for proper commissioning of new equipment. It is important to find the right wording when asking questions and asking the same question 5 times is a useful method in finding the right wording. Be persistent, emphasize starting a discussion, and identify actionable steps. Below is interaction demonstrating this method

1st Question: How do I connect a 3rd party device to a machine PLC?
* That’s not possible, 3rd parties are not allowed to have access to our internal devices

2nd Question: What is the safest way to exchange information between these 2 devices?
* The 3rd party device connected to the PLC should only be able to read the data from the PLC, not write any changes. 

3rd Question: If I just want the device to have the same settings as those entered on the machine, how could that be achieved?
* Controls needs the list of the data tags the device will be reading and the vendor needs to program the device to read the machine data and react accordingly

4th Question: How will the device physically connect to the machine?
* We just need to run an ethernet cable between the 2

5th Question: This is intended for planning out exact next steps and assigning responsibility
